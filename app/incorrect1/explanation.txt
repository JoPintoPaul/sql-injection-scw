In this attempt, we attempt to reject any user input string that contains the word "DELETE".

Although this would prevent the attack seen previously, what if the attack vector consisted instead of using a DELETE statement,
for example:
"Jane"
"Smith'; UPDATE users SET username = 'Fake Username' WHERE '1'='1"

This would give us a SQL statement of:
"INSERT INTO users VALUE 'Jane Smith'; UPDATE users SET username = 'Fake Username' WHERE '1'='1';"

The UPDATE statement example would return true for all rows, and all rows in the table would have the username "Fake Username",
effectively wiping out your usernames. So, we can see thatthis solution could work for one specific attack, but it is still
open to many more vulnerabilities.
